                <p class="text-muted text-left">BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming-of-age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.</p>

                    Lyrics that brutally lay open reality as it is deliver a bold admonition to a world that inflicts despair. Children are raised as studying machines without a chance to think about the future.
                    A world where classmates are not friends but competitors trying to trample each other. BTS sings about the wounds and anguish that such hopeless life has left on today’s teens.</p>

They warn the girl who acts like she doesn't love them not to test their love anymore. The boys are no longer in their school uniforms. They have become tougher, singing that their love is not to be treated lightly. A year and two months into their debut, BTS made sure that the visuals, performance and all the elements of their first studio album are flawless. Tracks that highlight the different genres of hip hop—South, West, Boom Bap and Trap—provide a clear direction of BTS' music. The title track “Danger” is a tightly-composed hybrid hip hop song with a piercing punk-rock guitar sound that features stark rap, a powerful hook and exhilarating shouting.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">BTS has come back with their third mini album, The most beautiful moment in life pt.1.No longer just young boys, the album is an introduction to BTS as a group that continues to grow and develop. In each track are distilled poetic and pop emotions that allows the listener to sense both the soft and the resounding musical transformation of the group.After successfully concluding the “School Trilogy” that discusses the main topics of interest for teens—dreams, happiness and love—the new album begins to discuss “youth”. BTS has chosen the theme of “the most beautiful moment in life”, the start of one’s young adulthood in which beauty coexists with uncertainty.The most beautiful moment in life pt.1 focuses on the uncertain future more than the glamour of youth. In addition, while previous lyrical work had been credited to the rappers (RM, SUGA and j-hope), the vocal members (Jin, Jimin, V, Jung Kook) have now added their names to the credits for this album’s producing and songwriting.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">Seven young men on the threshold of their 20s. Now entering their young adulthood, the members of BTS sang in their previous album, The most beautiful moment in life pt.1, about people their age being threatened by uncertainty. Released seven months after that first installment, The most beautiful moment in life pt.2 sings about the energy of youth barreling forward, embracing even the uncertainty and insecurity. Now beginning to taste the bitterness of grown-up life, they can easily sense that life isn't always beautiful. However, they continue to sprint forward, relying only on their two destitute legs and the fire in their hearts. There’s nothing else to do but keep running. Facing the powerlessness of one’s youth, they collide and shatter and still cry out that “it’s okay to fall, it’s okay to get hurt.” That is the beauty of this moment.Continuing the tradition of the previous album, the members including RM, SUGA, j-hope, V and Jung Kook add their names to the producing and songwriting credits, showing their own growth as musicians. The lyrics are more profound and the music more passionate. The “Youth Series” concludes with The most beautiful moment in life pt.2, but the boys are only now on the starting line. “Never Mind”, BTS is just getting started.</p>

            <h4><p>Jeon Jung-kook (Korean: 전정국; born September 1, 1997), better known mononymously as Jungkook, is a South Korean singer and songwriter. He is the youngest member of and vocalist in the South Korean boy band BTS.
                <br><br>
                Jeon Jung-kook (Korean: 전정국) was born on September 1, 1997, in Busan, South Korea. His family consists of his parents and an elder brother. He attended Baekyang Elementary and Middle School in Busan. When he became a trainee, he transferred to Singu Middle School in Seoul. Jungkook initially had dreams of becoming a badminton player when he was young, but after seeing G-Dragon perform "Heartbreaker" on television, it influenced him to want to become a singer. 
                <br><br>
                In 2011, Jungkook auditioned for the South Korean talent show Superstar K during its auditions in Daegu. Though he was not selected, he received casting offers from seven entertainment companies. He eventually chose to become a trainee under Big Hit Entertainment after seeing RM, now his fellow band member and leader in BTS, perform. To work on his dance skills in preparation for debut, he went to Los Angeles during the summer of 2012 to receive dance training from Movement Lifestyle. In June 2012, he appeared in Jo Kwon's "I'm Da One" music video and also worked as a backup dancer for Glam before his debut. He graduated from Seoul's School of Performing Arts, an arts high school, in 2017. In November 2016, he decided to forgo taking the CSATs, Korea's nationwide university entrance exam. As of 2020, he is enrolled at Global Cyber University, majoring in Broadcasting and Entertainment.
